                 On September 28, 1929, Lata Mangeshkar was born in Indore and went on to
                 become the most well-known playback vocalist in Bollywood history. For 
                 more than 50 years, she performed songs on records of every genre (ghazals, pop, etc.) 
                 for actresses ranging from Nargis to Preity G Zinta. She was classified as the most
                 recorded artist in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records between 948 and 1987,
                 when she recorded at least 30,000 solo, duet, and chorus-backed songs in 20 Indian languages,
                 until the 1991 edition, when her entry vanished. That quantity may have risen to 40,000 today!
            <p>
                She was born the child of the well-known classical vocalist and theater company owner Dinanath Mangeshkar. Lata began receiving
                 singing lessons from him when she was five years old. She also received instruction from renowned singers Aman Ali Khan Sahib and 
                 Amanat Khan.She had a musical talent that was given to her by God at an early age, and she was able to first-time master voice exercises.

                Ironically, for someone of her size, she entered Bollywood at the wrong period, in the 1940s, when extremely nasal bass
                 singers like Shamshad Begum and Noor Jehan were popular. Many projects were turned down for her because it was thought that her 
                 voice was too thin and high-pitched. Her father passed away in 1942, placing the burden of providing for her family on her, forcing her to 
                 perform in as many as eight Hindi and Marathi films between 1942 and 1948 to help with financial difficulties. Her circumstances upon 
                 entering the industry were no less unfavorable.

                She did, however, get her big break in 1948 with Ghulam Haider in the movie Majboor (1948), and 1949 saw the release of four of her
                 movies: Mahal (1949), Dulari (1949), Barsaat (1949), and Andaz (1949). All four of them were huge successes, with their songs reaching
                  levels of previously unheard popularity. Within a year, she had completely changed the face of playback singing thanks to her
                   exceptionally high-pitched singing, making the then-current style of excessively nasal voices obsolete. Geeta Dutt and Shamshad Begum 
                   were the only two lower-pitched singers to somewhat withstand her treble assault.

                She started out with a vocal technique that was similar to Noor Jehan, but she eventually transcended it and developed her 
                own unique sound. The two of them were the queens of Indian playback singing through the 1990s. Her sister Asha Bhosle also rose to
                 fame in the late 1950s. Her voice had a distinctively adaptable character that allowed music composers to ultimately push the 
                 boundaries of their imaginative endeavors. The composers C. Ramchandra and Madan Mohan made her sound her sweetest and pushed her
                  voice unlike any other music director, even though all of her songs were instant blockbusters under any composer.
